# UNITE Toolbox

The main idea of the UNITE project is that information theory can provide a framework to unify the assessment of models based in physics, to completely data-driven and anything in between.

In this set of tools we bring together different methods to estimate quantities from information (such as entropy, kullback-leibler divergence and mutual information), using different estimators. The current estimators available are: binned frequencies, kernel density estimates and k-nearest neighbors.
